#Overview

This is a demo of a simple DEV workflow using git on your local desktop. 

We assume that you already have a remote repo created on GitHub or wherever.

Note that the default branch in my repo is "mainline". 
Yours likely is different. Alter accordingly. 


# switch to root directory where you plan to store your repo(s)
cd /Users/stevewatkins/Downloads/CodeLouisville/sw

# clone your remote repo to your local path
git clone https://github.com/stevewatkins17/PythonForDataAnalysis.git

# switch to your newly cloned repo's root dir
cd PythonForDataAnalysis

# verify git status
git status 

# do work - add/change existing files ....

# to verify file changes
git status 

# to remove an unwanted directory & its files, for example the Jupyter Notebook temp dir ".ipynb_checkpoints"
# in the future you can use ".gitignore" to exclude files by name or pattern
rm -fr .ipynb_checkpoints/

# Once finished (enough), stage for tracking files that have been modified.
git add -A

# commit local files 
git commit -m "init commit new files"

# push the local branch to remote origin (in this example, pushing to origin is merely backing up)
git push -u origin mainline

# At this point, your remote repo should be perfectly in-sync with your local repo. Rinse & repeat for continued changes.
